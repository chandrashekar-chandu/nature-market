Here's when you should implement additional frontend pages like Profile in your NaturesMart project:

Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1: Core E-commerce Flow)
Before Profile page, focus on completing the basic shopping flow:

Cart page - Users need somewhere to view their selected items
Product Details page - Individual product views with full descriptions
Checkout/Order flow - Payment and order completion
When to Build Profile Page (Phase 2: User Management)
Implement Profile page after the core shopping flow is working. This should include:

User account information
Order history
Address management
Password change functionality
Recommended Development Order:
Now: Backend API (authentication, database)
Next: Cart → Product Details → Checkout
Then: Profile → Order History → Password Reset
Later: Admin Dashboard → Product Management
Finally: About, Contact, FAQ pages
Why This Order?
Users need to complete purchases before managing their profiles
Core shopping functionality drives revenue
Profile features depend on working authentication
Admin features are secondary to customer experience
Would you like me to help implement the Cart page first, or would you prefer to start with the Profile page despite the recommended order?
